## My Busking Page

See the deployed version on https://buskingkhai.netlify.app!

## Introduction
This is a audience-facing web application created to allow audience to find out more about myself when I am busking. The main goal is to enhance engagement with the audience, allowing them to:

1. Request Songs
2. Tip me through cashless methods (PayNow)
3. Find out more about me.

The web application is designed with mobile interfaces in mind as it will mostly be accessed through scanning a QR code displayed when I am busking.
An intuitive user interface is required to cater to the largely transient target audience who mostly do not have time to stop.

## Project Description

Frontend: NextJS with Typescript
Database: Google Firebase
CSS: Material-Tailwind

Deployed on Netlify

## Features

This web application is largely static with the most important feature being a song request system that writes onto the database. More complex functionalities are implemented on the admin page.

1. A real-time song request system that allows users to add requests with song titles, artists and additional requests/remarks onto the database. (Requests will be viewed by me on the admin webpage, which is hosted on a separate repository.)
2. A tip page that allows users to download my PayNow QR code, and leave a message for me.
3. Displays inks for my social media and a writeup about myself.

There are no future plans at the moment as I find the audience facing page satisfactorily functional for now. I have designed the application to be as extensible as possible to support any further functionalities that I may want to add in the future.
